# ASM4_MY472
This repo includes my report and code appendix for Assignment 4 of MY472.

## Guidelines for Code Execution Order
To ensure optimal formatting and presentation, the code blocks in the RMarkdown file have been arranged in a specific order. For first-time execution, please begin running the code from the section immediately following the final paragraph of the report, where data processing commences, and proceed to the end of the document. Subsequently, you can execute the code chunks located within the report itself, primarily focused on visualization.

Attempting to run the code chunks within the report section first may lead to unexpected issues due to the sequence of the code blocks. I appreciate your understanding and patience in following these guidelines.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. In your repository, you'll find a file named 'spotify_api.env'. This file contains the template for environment variables needed by the scripts, without actual values for security reasons.
3. Go to Spotify Web API page: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api, follow the instruction to create an app, and get your Client ID and CLIENT Secret.
4. Open the spotify_api.env file and fill them in that required for the scripts to run.

Note: The spotify_api.env file is provided to ensure code reproducibility without revealing sensitive information.
