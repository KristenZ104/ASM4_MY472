# ASM4_MY472
This repo includes my report and code appendix for Assignment 4 of MY472.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. In your repository, you'll find a file named .env.example. This file contains the template for environment variables needed by the scripts, without actual values for security reasons.
3. Copy the .env.example file to a new file and name it .env.
4. Open the .env file and fill in your API keys and other sensitive data required for the scripts to run.
Note: It is not advisable to upload your .env file to your GitHub repository, as it can expose your API keys. The .env.example file is provided to ensure code reproducibility without revealing sensitive information. Just replicate the structure in the .env.example file with your actual credentials in the .env file.
