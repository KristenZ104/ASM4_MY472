# ASM4_MY472
This repo includes my report and code appendix for Assignment 4 of MY472.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. In your repository, you'll find a file named 'spotify_api.env'. This file contains the template for environment variables needed by the scripts, without actual values for security reasons.
3. Go to Spotify Web API page: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api, follow the instruction to create an app, and get your Client ID and CLIENT Secret.
4. Open the spotify_api.env file and fill them in that required for the scripts to run.

Note: The spotify_api.env file is provided to ensure code reproducibility without revealing sensitive information.
